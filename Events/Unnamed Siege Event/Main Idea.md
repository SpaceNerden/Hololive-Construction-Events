# Unnamed Siege Event

A combination of bedwars, capture the flag, and TNT wars.


## Player Roles
Players pick a kit (role) before joining the game. Some players may recieve a "Special Kit" randomly. The kits are as follows:
### Fighters
Fighters fight. They have the best armor and weapons out of all roles and must defend their base and attack the enemies.
#### Items
1. Diamond Sword (Special: Netherite Sword)
2. Diamond Armor
3. Colored Shield
4. 64 Steak
5. 16 Ender Pearls
6. 1 Strength 2 Potion
7. 1 Swiftness 2 Potion
8. Special: 10 Golden Apples

### Archers
Archers go pew pew. They are supporting the fighters by being spotters and snipers. They have ok armor and weapons, but rather retreat when confronted.
#### Items
1. Bow (Special: Power 5, Punch 2)
2. 32 Arrows (Special: Instant Damage Tipped Arrows)
3. 32 Spectral Arrows
4. Iron Sword
5. Iron Pickaxe (Pressure plates only)
6. Iron Armor
7. 64 Steak
8. 16 Ender Pearls
9. 1 Swiftness 3 Potion
10. 1 Jump Boost (for 2 block jump) Potion

### Engineers
Engineers fortify the home base and breach the enemy base. They have minimal armor, and only has a knockback stick. Retreating is a must when encountring an enemy.
#### Items
1. Knockback 1 Stick
2. Iron Pickaxe (Special: Diamond Pickaxe)
3. Iron Shovel (Special: Diamond Shovel)
4. Shears
5. Redstone Toolbox (Redstone, Repeaters, Comparators, Prefilled Dispensers, Buttons, Levers, Pressure Plates, TNT Minecarts (Yes, Landmines.) and maybe even some skulk sensors when server is 1.19 updated?)
6. Special: Crossbow (Multishot, Unbreaking 3)
7. Special: 32 Fireworks (4 stars, Flight Duration 3)

## Role System Goals
The goal with this system is that a team cannot rush the enemy by only choosing fighters, as (in 1.19 especially) landmines can shoot them up into the sky and deal heavy damage. To counter this, a part of their team will need to be archers, so that they can either: Intentionally detonate the landmine by shooting arrows at the pressure plate or making enough noise to trigger the skulk sensor. However, Fighters and Archers cannot beat the game on its own. They would need the engineers to break through the walls of the fort and let everyone in. You can't have engineers rush the fort because they have bad armor and can easily be killed by either Landmines, TNT cannons, or good ol' fireworks.

To keep the game interesting, a random player will be given special versions of their chosen kits. These are meant to give a little more life (and maybe some scuff) to the battlefield.


## Player Teams
A team must be roughly equal in size, adjusting accordingly. (E.g., If there is a PvP warlord in 1 team, that team gets less players).

## Arena
For now, I'll be copying parts of cities/towns and modifying it a little. Later on, I plan to make (or look for) dedicated maps for these kinds of events.

The flags will be placed in 3 places. Every location must be Staff/Event Team approved so that players don't go in caves looking for it. It must clearly be in a man-made structure, and a player must be able to walk (not crawl) to the flag without difficulties.

1 flag will be selected as a "Home fort". Travel between the home fort and the outposts are up to the team. 

Players are given 30 minutes to prepare all defenses. The defences may include landmines, walls, chokepoints, TNT cannons, lava walls. There will be a reasonable limit to the placing limits. During this time, all players can help fortify the forts.
## Game Rules
1. No items must go out, or in. All players are expected to stash their belongings in a chest before joining.
2. Players cannot drop items. (Command block based method is nice, but I'd rather make a dedicated plugin for all my events. Not sure why, but it seems easier.)
3. Unlimited respawns until all flags are down, spawn on the home fort.
